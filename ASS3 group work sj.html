<h2>Position 1 – Digital Designer</h2>
<p>The digital designer would be tasked with making sure that Gallery Exhibitor looks presentable and stylish. Gallery Exhibitor is a website for displaying pieces of art. This means that as it develops, the visual presentation is paramount. The Digital Designer would also handle the ‘User Experience’ (UX) and ‘User Interface’ (UI) of Gallery Exhibitor.  It is important to us that visitors to the digital galleries have a clean and visually stimulating experience while using the website. This is where a Digital Designer would really help. </p>
<h3>Appropriate Skills</h3>
<p>The most necessary skill for a Digital Designer is a background in graphic design. The other roles in our team are more focused on the technical side of things - this leaves the Digital Designer to center their time on the presentation of the finished product. They should have an understanding of the principles of design and have a number of design jobs on their resume already. They should be able to use tools like photoshop and illustrator to create logos, graphics, and other images. As a UX/UI Designer, they should know well how people use websites. Two main groups of people will be using our website: ‘exhibitors’ and ‘visitors’. The Digital Designer must have the skills to keep both of their experiences in mind. They must also be skilled with 3D environments, as Gallery Exhibitor is a 3D experience. </p>
<h3>Teamwork and Leadership</h3>
<p>As with the other three positions, leadership and teamwork are important for the Digital Designer. As the driving force behind the look and experience of the website, they must have enough leadership to take charge on it themselves. Teamwork is important too, as they will be asked to implement new ideas that the other people in the team have. They will need to think on their feet and be prepared to change the layout and look of Gallery Exhibitor at the whims of the other roles and as they get feedback from the users.</p>
<br>

<h2>Position 2 – WebGL Developer</h2>
<p>The most important part of Gallery Exhibitor is the 3D gallery experience, which uses the WebGL 2.0 game engine. To help with this, we would look for a WebGL Developer to make the best gallery possible for our exhibitors and visitors. The WebGL Developer would oversee the 3D gallery, making sure that the 3D gallery was easily navigable, and making any changes to the overall structure when asked by another team member.</p>
<h3>Appropriate Skills</h3>
<p>Of course, the most appropriate skill for the WebGL Developer is proficiency in WebGL. They would also need to be familiar with HTML, within which the WebGL content would be contained. It’s important that the site all fits together as one seamless package, so the WebGL Developer would need to work on that as well. They should have a firm grasp on 3D Modelling, as well as textures and lighting. They would have to be able to handle many different sorts of textures and lighting, as exhibitors will want all sorts of different things from the gallery. The last thing that they will need to manage is the way that visitors will move through the 3D space, to ensure that there aren’t any glitches or errors. The aim of Gallery Exhibitor is to create a digital gallery which replicates a ‘real’ gallery, so the WebGL Developer would need to be proficient enough in WebGL to create a gallery which feels real. </p>
<h3>Teamwork and Leadership</h3>
<p>As this venture-capital-funded team is still small, the teamwork of the WebGL Developer is very important. They will need to lead the way with the WebGL side of things, and take initiative when things need a little work. They will need to work with the Digital Designer closely, as it will be up to them to put the designs into action. Leadership is important too of course, as the other team members will need to listen to the WebGL Developer, as they control the most important aspect of the website – the gallery. </p>
<br>

<h2>Position 3 – Database Manager</h2>
<p>Gallery Exhibitor, when up and running, will need to manage the pictures and videos of many exhibitors, as well as the data of many accounts. For this, we will hire a Database Manager, to keep everyone’s data and information in check. Unlike the WebGL Developer and the Digital Designer, the role of Database Manager is firmly on the back end of things, but their job is not any less necessary. Users of Gallery Exhibitor will expect us to keep their exhibits safe, and not too compressed. As we are dealing with art here, the images and video can’t loose too much quality in compression – this would be detrimental to the quality of the experience. This means that the data will take up more space, but as the galleries will be temporary, the files in the database can also have a time limit. This will all be the purview of the Database Manager.
</p>
<h3>Appropriate Skills</h3>
<p>For the Database Manager, we will be looking mostly for a candidate with a strong background in database management. Without careful management of the databases, our project will fall apart. They will need to have problem-solving skills, to work on their feet whenever an issue arises. Their attention to detail is also very important, as small issues can lead to big problems when dealing with databases. Due to the importance of this role in the team, we will be looking for someone who has a major qualification in Database Management, to ensure that everything runs smoothly.</p>
<h3>Teamwork and Leadership</h3>
<p>The Database supplies information to all the other parts of the website, so the communication skills of the Database Manager will be key to the project succeeding. They’ll be working mostly on their own, but their work will be helping everyone else. So, the Database Manager must listen to the rest of the team, because they will be often called upon to help integrate the database into the visual design, the user experience, or the 3D environment. I predict that their teamwork will be important, but they won’t have to use it as often as some of the other roles. </p>

<h2>Position 4 – Quality Assurance</h2>
<p>The final of the four positions that we would hire would be someone to oversee Quality Assurance. They would monitor all aspects of how people are reacting to Gallery Exhibitor, working closely with the Digital Designer to implement feedback. They would be the role most in touch with the users of the website, even using social media outreach to monitor complaints and suggestions. They would also manage a particular part of the site which would allow users to submit and vote on feature requests. Another important role for the Quality Assurance employee would be to conduct regular performance testing, to make sure that the site was constantly performing well. As Gallery Exhibitor would be a global service, it is important that the website stays up and usable at all times of the day.</p>
<h3>>Appropriate Skills</h3>
<p>Unlike the other roles, an extremely important part of this role is an awareness and ability to interact with the public. They would need to be friendly, and well-spoken when dealing with the exhibitors and visitors. They would also need to have a particularly good understanding of the bigger picture of the project, so that they could call upon that knowledge when needed. They would need to be able to keep an open mind, and be open to suggestions and complaints from users of the website. On the more technical side of things, they would need to be capable with all major operating systems (including mobile operating systems) and testing services like LambdaTest in case anything goes wrong. They would need to be good on social media and email, to keep on top of what people had to say about Gallery Exhibitor.  </p>
<h3>Teamwork and Leadership</h3>
<p>Clear and open communication is most important for this role, not only when dealing with the public. They would need to talk often with the people in the other roles to make sure that any problems with the site could be quickly and efficiently fixed. If a user had a question about a more technical aspect of the site, they would need to ask the right team member to get the right answer. And finally, if a user suggested a new feature, they would need to know whether that feature was viable and reasonable. Their leadership skills will also be crucial – they must be able to band the team together to focus on what’s important for the most important people in Gallery Exhibitor – the users.</p>
