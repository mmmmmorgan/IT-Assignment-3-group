        <h2>Group Processes</h2>
        <h3>Mingrui</h3>
        <p>Our group worked well together in Assignment 2. However, we also encountered some problems as well. First, sometimes members miss the meetings because they can't communicate smoothly, so we will improve the communication on Assignment 3. Using when2meet, we can choose the time when all members are free, so we can organize our group meetings better. Secondly, I did not schedule the task time well in Assignment 2, which led to a time crunch at the end. Therefore, this time I will set a schedule to better organize the time I need for my tasks. </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Anh</h3>
        <p>Looking back at assignment 2, our group did well in terms of dividing the tasks and completing group work together. However, sometimes we have issues with the meeting as our member’s availability may not line up, which can be concluded as communication issue as well. With assignment 3, we decided to use the website when2meet, which takes all of our availability and decide a time for us to meet. For me personally, I decided to organize my time, making a plan on a calendar to decide which time to do a task to help me be more on top of it compared to assignment 2. </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Kabir</h3>
        <p>Our group was able to work effectively together to complete the work required for Assignment 2, as a group like most things we had our strengths and weaknesses when working together I believe for us our major strength was being able to always overcome and move past any difficulties as we had been easily able to adapt and change to any issues that occurred. I believe for assignment 2, the key issues we dealt with was team member availability and being able to have every come together at one point and time, to address this problem, we devised a new meeting scheduling method that involves utilizing the website when2meet, which takes into account all our availability and assigns a time for us to meet.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Brian</h3>
        <p>Although our group pulled it all together in the end, I believe there are some noticeable improvements that can be taken from Assignment 2 and applied for Assignment 3. This is largely because communication via Microsoft Teams is not completely optimal, and scheduling availabilities being difficult to work around. This time, during Assignment 3, we have opted to use a new scheduling software called when2meet, which allows a range of time availabilities, rather than limited to days. This quickly helps us see the exact hours at which all group members are available for a meeting.</p>

        <h3>Darcy</h3>
        <p>For Assignment 2 our group worked together sufficiently, completing the various tasks to a quality standard. An area that needed improvement for Assignment 3 was the proficiency at communication. Given the timeframe of the course, it seemed natural for this to be a point of development for our group. With the additional technological communicative steps required by the course, like the use of Microsoft teams, this made it an even slower process to adapt. However, we’ve gotten better at it generally, being able to divide the workload and express our progress. Scheduling was a primary lapse in the communicative barrier we encountered, so this time we used a website ‘meet2meet’ to help organise.</p>

        <h2>Career Plans </h2>
        <h3>Kabir</h3>
        <p>The career plan that I have for becoming a Network Architect is fairly different from what most of my team members have detailed in their plan. I would say that there are more similarities than differences between everyone’s career plan, we all have obviously chosen to go in the IT industry but the field we have chosen in that industry is nearly completely different for every person and another interesting difference I noted was that regarding average base salary per annum my job ranked the highest by quite substantial amount compared to everyone else’s ideal jobs. Another significant difference I noted is the varying levels of job demand for each position and the amount of the difference there was, as on the top was the position of Web Developer which had 381 jobs posting but on the low end with a 156% difference the ideal job of a Technical Support only gets 47 job postings. As a group we shared a lot of similarities for the general skills required for our ideal jobs but that did remain the case for required IT-specific skills as that had varied quite a bit due to the technologies we would be dealing with those positions. </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Anh</h3>
        <p>For me, the career plan I have for becoming a Software Developer is quite similar to most of my group members. As we all are in the IT industry, our plan is quite similar. My ideal position as a Software Developer is on the higher end of the job demand, with over 300 job listings, similar to the highest demanding job in our group of Web Developer with 381 job listings. Common element includes the skills required, our general skills are quite similar with communication and teamwork being extremely important in this industry, working with other people on data...There wasn’t really differentiated our positions from each other, apart from a bit of job demands, and salary was largely similar. </p>

        <h3>Kabir</h3>

        <br>
      
      <h3>Mingrui</h3>
      <p>My career plan remains the same, I still feel that web developer is a good job for me, I fully play my again in the group and work with the members who have various tasks. This assignment showed me that my programming skills are lacking and I still need to strengthen my skills in IT. I will also work harder in my future studies. </p>
      <br>

        <h3>Brian</h3>
        <p>My career plan has not changed between assignments, although after some programming exercises in Assignment 3, I do feel like the road into software development isn’t impossible. Although, I still believe working up the Systems Configurations ladder is my preferred career path in order to achieve my dream title as Senior Systems Administrator. The common elements this title has with others, such as Anh’s Software Developer and Kabir’s Network Architect, is the ability to solve problems, work with teams by communicating efficiently and effectively.</p>
      <br>

        <h3>Darcy</h3>
        <p>Career-wise, I still wish to become a Tech Support worker. That has not changed. What this Assignment has shown me is my lack of ability in programming, reinforcing my aptitude in generalist IT skills required for Tech Support and eliminating prospect of other roles such as Software Development. Although, as I’m not studying a Bachelor of IT, and only writing this now as part of a school elective, any IT employability would be much harder for me.  </p>
