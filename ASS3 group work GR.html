    <p>After an initial hurdle in gathering and communicating with group members, the following weeks went smoothly. Due to the usage of scheduling software and MS Teams communication, group members were able to provide their availabilities for a group meeting each week. The allocation of group work also went well, with each member contributing fairly and efficiently, and allowed for members to focus their efforts to produce higher quality content within a given timeframe. Project meeting minutes were met each week, with each meeting having clear agendas and discussions on the project’s tasks. However, improvements could be made, such as difficulties in scheduling due to uncontrollable circumstances. What surprised me was the discussion and contribution of each member during the meetings online, and especially during face-to-face meetings. I learned that each member could contribute to a project in their own way to maximize quality and different perspectives.</p>

    <p>Working in a group definitely changed the way I tackle the assignments. Before this, I'm used to doing everything on my own/with help from teachers. But as I worked through assignment 2 and 3 with my group, I realized it is much better to work together, communicate, help each other out when there is a problem and just overall working together as a group. I found dividing tasks, doing one’s own part and help others to be a very efficient way to complete a project.</p>

    <p>Thanks to assignment 2, I was more prepared for the harder group work of assignment 3. I enjoyed the teamwork and ‘sharing the load’ that group work presented, and I now have a greater appreciation for how all the parts of a good team can work together and bring a big project to completion. Also, I’ve liked learning about all sorts of digital time management tools, and I’m looking forward to using them in future group projects.</p>

    <p>In the process of completing the group work the understanding of cooperation is deepened, and members will communicate with each other and help each other when they encounter difficulties, which is much more useful than when they can only meditate on their own when they encounter problems alone. It also improved my communication skills and my time planning.</p>
    <h4>Kabir</h4>
    <p>When working in a group, I learned and experienced that there is always someone willing to help you with whatever problem you may have. As I am not used to working on assignments with others, so whenever an issue arose, I was left to figure it out on my own. However, when working in a group, I was able to discuss the problem with my team members, who, to my surprise, were always more than willing to assist me.</p>

I’m proud of Team Gamers. We communicated well in the end and completed the duties to a high standard, better than that of our Assignment 2. We all contributed well and pulled our own weight. We worked to our strengths. I personally added the project idea and shared in parts of the assignment. For improvement we could have planned better. I was surprised at how proficiently we communicated, and have learned of its value when working in a group. </p>
